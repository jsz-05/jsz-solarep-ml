# Solar Energetic Particles:

### 1. Elements:
High Priority elements:
- Fe (Iron): Iron is a key element in SEP due to wide range of charge states, and a high Q(Fe) correlation with the Fe/O ratio is significant.
- O (Oxygen): Oxygen is another abundant element and serves as a good reference point when analyzing charge state ratios (like Fe/O).
- Si (Silicon): Silicon, while less abundant than Fe or O, also exhibits a range of charge states

### 2. Time-intensity profiles of SEPs:
- These show how the flux of SEPs changes over time. The exponential decay is a characteristic pattern observed in  flux profiles.
- Load info from SIS into dataframe (Fe, O, Si flux from 2017 to Q1 2024)
- Compute statistics (mean, STD, determine cutoff for noise)
- Examine the flux data for sudden, significant increases in particle flux (SEP events)
- Zoom in on the periods after the initial peak, where the flux gradually decreases. These are the decay phases
